This is a very simple problem which you most probably never see in a real world coding competition, but in casual interviews, such questions are in abundance. These small questions with little logic also prove sometimes very difficult when you're nervous and sitting in front of a panel of people who are going to decide your future with the company.

The question states that there are `n` elephants each one numbered as `k` and of course, `k` is between [0,n]. The elephants can be happy only when they recieve as much as candies as their number. And there are `c` candies in total.

So the logic itself states for all elephants to be happy (which they will be when if they recieve candies equal to their number) then the sum of the numbers for the elphants should be less than equal to the number of candies.

And that's pretty much it. See if the number of candies is less than sum of numbers of elephants in the array, and give the result as "NO" and "YES" if it is more or equal.
