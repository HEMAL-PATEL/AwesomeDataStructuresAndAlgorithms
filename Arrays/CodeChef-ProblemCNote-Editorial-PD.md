Arrays are basically the starting point of cool things in any programming language. They are very easy to handle and code, and they provide reasonably fast operations and hence are preferred in many situations. This makes the arrays important and one of the favorite thing to pose problem on, especially in interviews.

In real world coding competetions you might rarely encounter a problem solely based on arrays, but most of the problem may need you to implement arrays for basic things. So you can't just ignore them.

This problem here, is just trying to make things confusing by putting in bunch of random stories. The problem's whole crux comes down to that the guy who has to buy the notebook has `k` money and you're given an array of `n` notebook which has `Pi` pages and `Ci` cost for `i"th"` one.

The guy also has to write some `x-y` pages and need only that many pages.

> So the logic and algorithm would be to find if cost is less than or equal to `k` and pages are greater than or equal to `x-y`

And if it is, you have to print `LuckyChef` and if it's not then print `UnluckyChef`, and that's it, folks!

**Problem Level: Very Easy**
