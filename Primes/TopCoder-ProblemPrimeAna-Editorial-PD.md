This is a very standard question that you might find in a real world coding competition. It is based much on mathematics and logic apart from Coding. For getting a efficient solution you have to be proficient in all of these things.

**(The solution and editorial is currently incomplete as the question statement was removed from the link given, but it will soon be completed)**

The question states that we are given a String of numbers, which has length between 3 to 8 characters. All of them are numbers and we have to find group of 3 primes from it.

The set of those 3 prime numbers should use all of the digits in the String given and have the minimum possible product in all of the other combinations of Primes that you might get from the given string.

So for this, you have to first efficiently be able to find if a number is Prime or not, Answer **[Sieve's Algorithm](https://github.com/Pradyuman7/AwesomeDataStructuresAndAlgorithms/blob/master/Primes/SieveAlgorithm-Editorial-PD.md)**.

Secondly you should be able to get all the permutations of the String given and thirdly you should use up all the optimisation you can think of, by removing the cases that are taking up time and are not of use.
