# Data-Structures And Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms for competitive coding. From Dummy to Expert.


We made this repo to learn DSA ourselves and making it a team project, we think this learning experience would turn out to be really fun.

Also this Repo will be having all the codes for important data structures and algorithms with explanation that will be helpful for everyone who is trying to be good at code.

We are also rating the problems based on their difficulty for us:

> PD's rating system: **Very Easy, Easy, Average, Hard, Very Hard**

> RD's rating system: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**
