# Data-Stuctures And Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms for competitive coding. From Dummy to Expert.


We made this repo to learn DSA ourselves and making it a team project, we think this learning experience would turn out to be really fun.

Also this Repo will be having all the codes for important data structures and algorithms with explanation that will be helpful for everyone who is trying to be good at code.

**Contents**

- [Stacks And Queues](https://github.com/Pradyuman7/AwesomeDataStructuresAndAlgorithms/tree/master/StacksAndQueues)

   Everything you may need to learn about Stacks and Queues, from beginner to expert level.
   
- [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/Pradyuman7/AwesomeDataStructuresAndAlgorithms/tree/master/Dynamic%20Programming)

   Things you must know before diving into DP problem solving.
